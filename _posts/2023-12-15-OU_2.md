<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>These radar loops were created for the Urban Areas and Supercells Capstone Project. Through a few Python scripts, I was able to transform them from NEXRAD files to a time-loop interface on ArcGIS Pro. These loops were used to analyze how supercells evolved as they moved over urban areas.</p>
