<h2>Synopsis</h2>
Liminal Spaces have recently risen into popularity on internet spaces. These devoid places hold different meanings to many people. For some, the now devoid areas provide a familiar sense of a nostalgic past. For others, they appear unsettlingly surreal- bordering on an uncanny valley. Regardless, all liminal spaces elicit a multitude of moods in their beholder.  

This project seeks to provide an interactive map of various kinds of liminal spaces. If you have encountered a liminal space and would like to share it, feel free to fill out the survey below the map!
