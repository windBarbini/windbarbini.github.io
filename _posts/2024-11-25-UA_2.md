<h2>Synopsis and Abstract</h2>
<p>On August 10th, 2020, a long-lived, line of thunderstorms known as a derecho ravaged through the Midwestern United States. While derechos are prolific producers of damaging winds, this particular system generated wind gusts of 140mph at its peak intensity. In addition, As a result, over $11 billion dollars in damages were incurred from Nebraska to Indiana, alongside many injuries and four deaths (NOAA). As previously explored in this class, </p>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>The project goals are as follows: </p>
<ol>
	<li>View landscape changes as a result of the storm, particularly where it was at its peak intensity.</li>
	<li>Decipher which bands exhibit the greatest spectral changes</li>
	<li>Decipher which indices best display the damage from the storm- particularly in cropland</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>This process involves four Landsat 8 images- two for before the storm, and two for after the storm.</p>

<p>The steps taken are as follows: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Obtain Landsat 8, Collection 2, Level 2 Imagery of Eastern Iowa via the USGS EarthExplorer site.</li>
	<li>Use ArcGIS Pro to create an extent shapefile.</li>
	<li>Use R to normalize the images (e.g. normalizing the before images to each other), with some code from Lab 4.</li>
	<li>Open the extent shapefile in R to crop the normalized before and after images.</li>
	<li>Save the cropped, normalized images as multiband raster TIF files.</li>
	<li>Use a separate R script to calculate indices such as NDVI for both images.</li>
	<li>Find the differences between the bands in the before and after images.</li>
	<li>Lastly, find the differences between the indices in the before and after images.</li>
</ol>
