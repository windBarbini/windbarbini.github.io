Emily Barbini recently graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a B.S. in Meteorology. She aims to obtain a M.S. in Meteorology, alongside a possibly a certification in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). She served as a Pathways Intern for the National Weather Service's West Gulf River Forecast Center (NWS WGRFC), where she fulfilled duties such as issuing river forecasts and helping push out the CatFIM 10% project. Emily's areas of expertise lie in surface-atmosphere interactions (particularly with cities), hydrometeorology, GIS, as well as severe weather. Although she no longer interns with the NWS WGRFC, she is still collaborating with them with an extensive research project- investigating how the topography of Dallas-Fort Worth impacts flooding in the surrounding region. 

True to the Barbini family nature, Emily also has a passion for the birds and aircraft that dwell in the very sky she studies. You can find some of her photography on her <a href="https://x.com/barbini_wx">Twitter</a> and this new website.
