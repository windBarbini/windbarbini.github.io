![alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/profile-placeholder.gif "Profile Picture"){:.profile}

Emily Barbini recently graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a B.S. in Meteorology. She aims to obtain a M.S. in Meteorology and possibly a certification in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Her areas of expertise lie in surface-atmosphere interactions (particularly with cities), hydrometeorology, GIS, as well as severe weather.

Emily served as a Pathways Intern for the National Weather Service's <a href="https://www.weather.gov/wgrfc/">West Gulf River Forecast Center</a> (NWS WGRFC) from June 2023 to August 2024. During this internship, she fulfilled duties such as issuing river forecasts and collaborating with the 10% implementation of the <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c7ae8422207241b5873fff38a22cf66b">CatFIM project</a>. Although Emily no longer interns with the NWS WGRFC, she is currently collaborating with them on a <a href="https://windbarbini.github.io/research/">research project</a>.

True to the Barbini family nature, Emily has a passion for the birds and aircraft that dwell in the very sky she studies. She also enjoys hobbies such as travelling and photography. You can find some of her photos on her <a href="https://x.com/barbini_wx">Twitter</a> and this new website.
